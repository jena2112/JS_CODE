// Array Methods

/*
push
arr1.push(5) this adds any element to the array 
pop
arr1.pop() this removes the last element of the array
unshift
 arr1.unshift(5) this adds as a first element to the array 
 shift
 arr1.shift() removes the first element of the array
*/
// arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

/* join
const newarry = arr1.join() 
this helps in binding and converts into string
*/

//slice/splice
arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
// console.log("A",arr1)
// const arr2= arr1.slice(1,3)
// console.log(arr2)
// console.log("B",arr1)

//splice
const arr3 =arr1.splice(1,3)
console.log(arr3)
console.log("c",arr1)

/*
splice()
Purpose: Modifies an array by adding or removing elements.
Syntax: array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)
start: Index at which to start changing the array.
deleteCount: Number of elements to remove from the array.
item1, item2, ...: Elements to add to the array, starting at the start index.
Returns: An array containing the removed elements.

slice()
Purpose: Creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array without modifying the original array.
Syntax: array.slice(start, end)
start: Index at which to start the extraction.
end: Index before which to end the extraction (not included).
Returns: A new array containing the extracted elements

splice changes the original array and can add/remove elements.
slice does not change the original array and creates a new array from a specified range.
